      "4": "And God saw that the light was good. And God separated the light from the darkness.",
      "5": "God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, the first day.",
      "6": "And God said, 'Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters.'",
      "7": "And God made the expanse and separated the waters that were under the expanse from the waters that were above the expanse. And it was so.",
      "8": "And God called the expanse Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, the second day.",
      "9": "And God said, 'Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear.' And it was so.",
      "10": "God called the dry land Earth, and the waters that were gathered together he called Seas. And God saw that it was good.",
      "11": "And God said, 'Let the earth sprout vegetation, plants yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind, on the earth.' And it was so.",
      "12": "The earth brought forth vegetation, plants yielding seed according to their own kinds, and trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.",
      "13": "And there was evening and there was morning, the third day.",
      "14": "And God said, 'Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens to separate the day from the night. And let them be for signs and for seasons, and for days and years,",
      "15": "and let them be lights in the expanse of the heavens to give light upon the earth.' And it was so.",
      "16": "And God made the two great lights—the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night—and the stars.",
      "17": "And God set them in the expanse of the heavens to give light on the earth,",
      "18": "to rule over the day and over the night, and to separate the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good.",
      "19": "And there was evening and there was morning, the fourth day.",
      "20": "And God said, 'Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the expanse of the heavens.'",
      "21": "So God created the great sea creatures and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarm, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.",
      "22": "And God blessed them, saying, 'Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.'",
      "23": "And there was evening and there was morning, the fifth day.",
      "24": "And God said, 'Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kinds—livestock and creeping things and beasts of the earth according to their kinds.' And it was so.",
      "25": "And God made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds and the livestock according to their kinds, and everything that creeps on the ground according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.",

      "27": "So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.",
      "28": "And God blessed them. And God said to them, 'Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth.'",
      "29": "And God said, 'Behold, I have given you every plant yielding seed that is on the face of all the earth, and every tree with seed in its fruit. You shall have them for food.'",
      "30": "And to every beast of the earth and to every bird of the heavens and to everything that creeps on the earth, everything that has the breath of life, I have given every green plant for food.' And it was so.",

      "6": "But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.",
      "7": "And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.",
      "8": "And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.",
      "9": "And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.",
      "10": "And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.",
      "11": "The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;",
      "12": "And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.",
      "13": "And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.",
      "14": "And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.",
      "15": "And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.",
      "16": "And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:",
      "17": "But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.",
      "18": "And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.",
      "19": "And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof.",
      "20": "And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him.",
      "21": "And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;",
      "22": "And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.",
      "23": "And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.",
      "24": "Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.",
      "25": "And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed."

      "43": "He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God.",

      "58": "He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered.",
      "59": "And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,",
      "60": "And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed.",
      "61": "And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.",
      "62": "Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate,",
      "63": "Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again.",
      "64": "Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first.",
